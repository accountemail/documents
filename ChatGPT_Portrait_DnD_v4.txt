One pitfall with the phrasing in Step 11 is that Chatty easily gets stuck in a rut of saying "... the unique and interesting details of the scene" or something similar. One concept I've found helpful is to tell it to use less common language, so something like Step 11: Use your imagination and creativity to generate a unique and interesting description, , incorporating the elements from steps 1-10. Please favor less common word choices and varied language styles."
